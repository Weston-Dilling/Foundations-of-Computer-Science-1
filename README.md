# Foundations-of-Computer-Science-1
All my code from CS 1 and CS  1 Lab. 
All of the code in this repository is extremely simple. Below I have a summary of what each prog and Lab assignment does. 
Each program has a more deatailed description within it that's commented out at the top.

prog0: Outputs personal info. Very similar to a "Hello world!" project.

prog1: A resturant caculator that gives you the price of a user inputted number of meals. Includes tax and prix fixe.

prog2: Takes a price (in cents) and the ammount paid (in cents), calculates the change and displays it to an output file.

prog3: Four function Calculator with two operands and +, -, *, and / operators. Also includes error messages for division by zero and unknown operator.

Lab 0: cout << "Hello World!" << endl;

Lab 2: Reads 3 grades from 3 differnet students from an input file and calculates thier averages.

Lab 3: if/else statement practice. You play rock paper scissors with the computer.

Lab 4: Very similar to prog 3.

Lab 5: Factorial calculator. Only works for integers between [0-12] and gives error statements if you enter a number not within those confines.

Lab 6: Finds all even or odd numbers from a user inputted int and displays them to the console. The program will keep repeting it self until the user terminates it 
       by selecting the appropriate option.
